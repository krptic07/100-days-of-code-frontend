**Today's Progress**: Completed upto 68% of the React Fundamentals part from freeCodeCamp.

**Link to work:** [Frontend Development Library - React (freeCodeCamp)] (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/react/pass-state-as-props-to-child-components)

### Day 2: September 8, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Made a Cart App from the React Course, using redux, react-redux and @reduxjs/toolkit

**Thoughts:** reduxjs/toolkit makes the work with redux, easier, a bit.

### Day 3: September 9, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Cart App. Learnt about making HTTPS calls and set up a backend database using Firebase

**Thoughts:** Having issues with POST calls and replies. Have to come back to it to fix it.

### Day 4: September 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Netflix clone app by cleverQazi.

**Thoughts:** Mostly saw the code and wrote it by following the video. The React part was basic. Main learning point was CSS.

### Day 5: September 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Netflix Clone App and deployed it on Firebase.

**Thoughts:** The App is just the landing page, with trailer popups using react-youtube and movie-trailer packages. Dont feel satisfied that much, as it was generally watch and code. Have to build more !
